## How to use Liri

* When `liri.js` file is run with node, it handles command line arguments similar to these below:

  ```

  node liri.js concert-this lady gaga
  ```

  and

  ```
  // Search for Lady Gaga's song "poker face"

  node liri.js spotify-this-song poker face
  ```
  and

  ```
  // Search for any movie, in this case "A star is born"

  node liri.js movie-this a star is born
  ```
   and

  ```
  // Use the random.txt file to search whatever is typed in there.

  node liri.js do-what-it-says
  ```
